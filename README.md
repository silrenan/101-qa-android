# Hello everyone
I am a student at EBAC - Escola Britância de Artes Criativas & Tecnológicas, and I have created this Github repository to upload my exercises for the Quality of Software course.

In this repository, you will find my assignments and project files, which I have created to enhance my understanding of software quality. I hope this repository will serve as a helpful resource for my fellow classmates who may need some extra guidance.

Please feel free to collaborate with me and offer any feedback or suggestions to help me improve my understanding of the course material.

Thank you for your time and support.
